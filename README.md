## Mod Description
This mod turns the enemies of Quake 4 into NPCs that the player can befriend by talking to them and providing them with gifts they like. To do so, this mod includes a market, a crafting system, and several collectable items around the map. NPCs may also give the player items if they are good enough friends, which can be used for crafting, selling, or regifting. Players also earn (or lose) friendship through occassional dialogue options provided by the NPC in question. Answers may increase or decrease friendship depending on what the NPC thinks of the player's response.
## What Has Been Changed
This mod adds new HUD elements to track currency and the amount of friends the player has made, as well as a new title and a help section on the main menu screen. Enemies will not do any damage to the player, and friendly AI will also do no damage to enemies, making the game entirely passive. Instead of killing enemies when shooting them, the mod treats this as the player "gifting" that weapon to the hit enemy. The player and necessary entities spawn in a new location so that everything can be tested quickly and easily.
## How to Test Deliverables
Everything has been put in the same general area for ease of testing. Player should be able to walk over items to pick them up, and shoot in the direction of an enemy to provide that item as a "gift".
