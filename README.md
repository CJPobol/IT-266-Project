## Mod Description
This mod turns the enemies of Quake 4 into NPCs that the player can befriend by talking to them and providing them with gifts they like. To do so, this mod includes a market, a crafting system, and several collectable items around the map. NPCs may also give the player items if they are good enough friends, which can be used for crafting, selling, or regifting. Players also earn (or lose) friendship through occassional dialogue options provided by the NPC in question. Answers may increase or decrease friendship depending on what the NPC thinks of the player's response.
